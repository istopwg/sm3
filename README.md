# sm3
The Semantic Model workgroup is responsible for maintaining the PWG Semantic Model and defining new mappings and abstract models as needed to support interoperability and data exchange between Imaging Systems. 
The PWG Semantic Model is an abstract version of the Internet Printing Protocol model and semantics.

In SM3, we add attributes from Print 3D, Cloud and System Services.
